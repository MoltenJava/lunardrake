								<h2>LunarDrake Freelance Policy</h2>
								<p>We ensure that all of our freelancers are treated well and with care, and we have dedicated ourselves to maintaining the freedom in freelancing.  However, we also believe in the security of our customers and their safety in transaction.</p>
								<p>All purchases that go through LunarDrake will be done through the LunarDrake exclusive middleman or a reputable external middleman.  We only accept Paypal through Friends and Family, but are willing to be flexible to meet our customers' demands.</p>
								<h2>Appeal Process</h2>
								<p>Though in our collective history of five or so years we have not had to invoke this policy, a customer may appeal to a higher member of staff in LunarDrake if their freelance work is not up to the quality we stand by.  This appeal is taken very seriously and is there to make our customers feel comfortable.</p>
